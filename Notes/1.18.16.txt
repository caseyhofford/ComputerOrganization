typedef struct tree_s tree_t, *tree_p;

struct tree_s{
  tree_p left, right;
  float data;
};

* means pointer

pointers are not always used, when a variable of a struct is created it contains the actual data, not a pointer
functions and process'

& followed by variable sends a reference, not the data
